# codecentric scrum for developers presentation

Built with reveal.js

This is still work in progress.

What I want to do is rebuild the scrum for developers presentation with reveal.js.

## Installation instructions

To look at it, just open the index.html.

To build it you need node installed. Then run (in a presentation folder):
```console
npm install
grunt serve
```
