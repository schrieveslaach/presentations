## Backlog Refinement

***

## Sprint Planning

* Part I
 * PO presents stories and priorities
 * Development-Team and PO discuss, what exactly is part of the story, what might be optional, etc.
 * Development-Team makes a forecast, what functionality it plans to achieve during the next sprint
* Part II
 * TODO: Task breakdown
 * It's a design meeting
 * Sketch the solution on the wall, flipchart, etc.
 * Draw GUI mock-ups (if not already done so by UX)
 * Have those sketches visible during the sprint
 * Do some research or look in the code base if necessary
 * Or time-box some research later, have a later task as a place holder

***

## Sprint Review/Demo

* Purpose?
 * Development Team: Experience competence
 * Product Owner: Get feedback from stakeholders
* Product Owner
 * Communicates current status and makes forecast on future features
* Team
 * Presents the done stories
 * Reports noteworthy events during the sprint
* Stakeholder
 * Reacts on new information

***

## Retrospective
<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 0.8em" -->

Prime Directive: "Regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job he or she could, given what was known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."

* 5 Phases (Book: Agile Retrospectives, Ester Derby & Diana Larson) <!-- .element: style="margin-bottom: 0" -->
 1. Setting The Stage
 2. Gathering Data
 3. Generate Insights
 4. Decide What to Do
 5. Closing

* Focus rather on system & process instead of individuals

* Add results to the Sprint Backlog, make somebody responsible

# Estimation
### Why?
### What?
### How?

***

<!-- .slide: class="center" style="text-align: center"-->
## Why estimate?

***

## Story Points

* Estimates are done in releative, unitless values
* You estimate only in relations, not absolutely
 * Story points stay constant over time
 * The teams velocity can change
 * Story points normalize skill level
 * Story points normalize done level
* Estimation can be done:
 * By Planning Poker (for few or new stories)
 * By Affinity Estimation (for a complete product backlog)
 * By Magic Estimation (similar to Affinity Estimation)

***

## Planning Poker

1. Product Owner presents and reads a new story
2. Every Development Team member chooses a card (1,2,3,5,8,13,20,40,100,?)
3. When everybody is ready, all cards are revealed
4. Are all cards in range of three (1-3, 2-5, 3-8, 5-13,...)?
 * If yes, continue at step 1
 * If no, Players with highest and lowest cards discuss their views for a moment. Then continue with step 2.

# Scrum Artifacts
### Definition of Done
### Task Board
### Sprint Burndown
### Velocity Chart

***

## Definition of Done

* Criteria for a software that is potentially shippable
* Can you ship you software after the sprint? If not, what is missing?
* Use the Definition of Done as a checklist during Sprint Planning II
* Make the DoD visible (nail it next to the task board)

***

## Task Board

* Task status and responsibility ![](img/task_board.png) <!-- .element: style="width:400px; float: right; margin-left: 10px" -->
* Continuously updated: New Tasks are added as they are discovered
* Reestimate remaining effort every day (up or down)

***

## Sprint Burn-Down Chart

* Daily summation of work remaining in Sprint ![](img/sprint_burndown.png) <!-- .element: style="width:400px; float: right; margin-left: 10px" -->
* Often goes up before it goes down
* Post for high visibility
* Reflects team intuition
* Not for anyone but the development team

***

## Velocity

* Used by the Product Owner to provice forecasts ![](img/velocity.png) <!-- .element: style="width:400px; float: right; margin-left: 10px" -->
* Used by the Development Team to gauge how much work to pull in a Sprint Planning meeting

***

## Product/Release Burn-Down Chart

* A Burn-Down chart shows ![](img/release_burndown.png) <!-- .element: style="width:400px; float: right; margin-left: 10px" -->
 * What has been achieved
 * What is left to do
* For a release, it shows remaining features to complete for a release
